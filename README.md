# ðŸ“š Learning Typescript

Learning typescript following along Stephen Grider's Udemy course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

I wanted to learn typescript to improve the safaty of my code.
Many tutorials show only the syntax of the langage, I wanted to learn what and when to use each feature.

## â™¬ Notes

The static directory is a very interesting project where most of typescript features are discussed in details. In particular, Stephen runs through the difference of using Inheritance and Composition (composition as meant in the GoF book). The different features of the project are implemented both ways and then discussed.
